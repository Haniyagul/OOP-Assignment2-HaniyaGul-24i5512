Assignment #2 (OOP) 

Course: CS2012 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming 

Semester: Fall 2025 

Name: Haniya Gul (FT-A) 





Summary 

This assignment includes tasks based on recursion, linked lists, stacks, and queues in C++. The aim was to practice OOP concepts and dynamic data structures.
 
Work Done  

Q1 - Recursion

-Wrote a recursive function to swap characters in a given range. 
-Printed a number pattern using recursion. 

Q2 - Singly Linked List (NASA features)

-Created base class `Feature` and derived classes `LandFeature` & `WaterFeature`. 
-Implemented a linked list to insert, delete, display, and reverse features. 

Q3 - Doubly Linked List (Library system) 

-Stored books with BookID, title, and author. 
-Added functions to insert, delete, and display forwards & backwards. 

Q4 - Queue (Movie ticket system)

-Implemented queue for customers. 
-Added enqueue, dequeue, and display. 

Q5 - Stacks + Analysis 

-Built array-based and linked-list-based stacks. 
-Converted recursion tasks to iterative version. 
-Compared time complexity of both stacks. 

 
Conclusion 

This assignment helped me understand recursion, OOP concepts, and how data structures like lists, queues, and stacks work internally in C++.
